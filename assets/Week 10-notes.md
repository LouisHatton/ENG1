# Week 10 Notes

Overview:

- Github project assessment 1 goals have all been moved to issues to allow separate comments and updates before the whole goal can be ticked off in projects
- We will now incorporate sprints in order to make documentation/organization of our project a lot easier, sprints can be found on the projects on the github
  - Github Project boards, managing individual tasks as issues. ([ENG1](https://github.com/LouisHatton/ENG1/projects/1) & [ENG1-website](https://github.com/LouisHatton/ENG1-website/projects/1))
- Some examples of 2D games made with libGDX have been put on the notes on google drive.

  - > Looks like this engine may be what we use?

- Now storing documentation on Github (ENG1-website/assets/deliverables)
  - for easy links and referencing to the project boards.
