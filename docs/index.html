      <!-- PLAN -->
      <div>
        <h3 id="plan">Project Plan</h3>
        <p>
          To begin, as a team, we put together an initial plan. This was
          demonstrated with a Gantt chart:
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/initial-plan.ba22c9c3.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          Gantt chart showing the initial plan to approach the project (not to
          exact dates).
        </p>
        <p>
          We discovered this approach was too detailed and as we began
          completing tasks it became progressively harder to achieve the initial
          goals we set out. Hence, we decided to change our approach to the
          planning and distribution of tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          This in turn was done by conducting 4 sprints of 2 weeks each
          adjusting the end goals as required within weekly group meetings on
          Wednesdays:

        <p class="caption">
          New updated Project plan with general goals for each sprint
        </p>
        <p>
          We redesigned our project overview to more general goals allowing for
          flexibility among the team. If issues arose or requirements where to
          change, these can be addressed when the team met and weekly plans
          adjusted as needed.

      <!-- WEEKLY SNAPSHOTS -->

        <h3 id="weeklysnapshots">Weekly Snapshots</h3>
        <p>
          Please find below each weeks plan, as a Gantt chart. These are shown
          within the sprints that they fall into. Hence, each chart covers 2
          weeks and we reviewed progress at weekly meetings on Wednesdays.

            This week, we planned our approach to working as a team and the
            software we would use to achieve this. In addition, the week
            consisted of individually reviewing the assessment brief to get a
            better understanding of the project.

          <p>
            This week, in addition to continuing research for a game engine and
            project risks, the primary aim was for each member and questions to
            be well prepared for the customer interview planned for the end of
            the sprint.

            At the start of the second sprint, the overall aim was to begin
            basic implementation of the game's classes working from the abstract
            software representation completed in the previous sprint.

          <p class="caption">The most up to date sprint plan for this week</p>
          <p>
            This week, the focus of the implementation was to begin basic game
            logic and UI to have a simple application which displays to the
            user. Furthermore, the overall website design finished at the end of
            this week, allowing for any further documents to be added once
            ready.

            Sprint 3 had a reduced number of objectives regarding documentation
            to reduce the workload for each member as we were approaching the
            common assessment period. Development continued, focusing on the
            requirements set out in the assessment brief.

            This week, the group had a short meeting to evaluate the current
            prototype and ensure the project was on track to be completed on
            time. Development continued at a slower pace due to ongoing exams.

            As we reached sprint 4, the overall aims were more focused on
            documentation, with more members working on these goals. As such the
            development of the game focused on refining areas, including the
            user experience with a reduced number of people working on these
            tasks.

          <p>
            This week, the focus on documentation continued, with tidying up and
            publishing finished documentation to the website. The game
            development reached it's finial stages and was checked by each
            individual to ensure all requirements set in the brief have been
            implemented effectively.
